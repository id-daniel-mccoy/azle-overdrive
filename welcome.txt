Welcome to Azle Overdrive!

To get started with this course, ensure that you have the correct tools installed and configured:

- Ubuntu v22.04
- GitHub CLI (git) Access
- Node v23.3.0 + NPM v10.9.0
- DFX v0.25.0
- Code Editor (Your Choice)

Inside of this repository is a PDF file for assisting with the setup.

After cloning this repository, if everything was setup correctly, you can run:

npm run setup

This should automate all of the configurations for the project moving forward. If for some reason part of it fails, these are the commands
for manual setup. You would have to run them inside of both the frontend and backend folders.

dfx killall
dfx start --clean --background
dfx canister create --all
dfx deploy
dfx stop

Those commands are also how you start a local replica of the Internet Computer blockchain and locally deploy your applications for testing.
